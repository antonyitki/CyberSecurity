Students who successfully complete the module will be able to:

    LO1: Evaluate solutions to privacy threats in transactional databases and data warehouses.

    LO2: Investigate measures that can be taken by both individuals and organizations including governments to prevent or mitigate the undesirable effects of computer crimes and identity theft.

    LO3: Analyse the trade-offs of balancing key security properties (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).

    LO4: Evaluate risks to privacy and anonymity in commonly used applications.

    LO5: Evaluate the purpose of cryptography and the ways it is used in data communications.

    LO6: Describe the issues of trust in interface design with an example of a high and low trust system.

#### Module Summary


Cyber-Security explores the risks and mitigations inherent to computer use.  The module incorporates ideas from ethical practice, risk management, legal considerations, and technology-based solutions to address computer security issues.  Cyber-Security begins by examining the concept of privacy from a philosophical, legal, and ethical stand-point, before exploring some of the technology used to protect an individualâ€™s privacy.  The module then continues by introducing foundational principles of computer security, including policies, legal frameworks, CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), threats, and attacks.  With these principles in place, the module explores secure design and the use of cryptography in computer systems.  Finally, human-factors, including interface design and governance are explored.

Cyber-Security brings together concepts covered in a range of modules throughout computing, including Computing and Society, Software Development 2, and Databases.  Cyber-Security explores how the issues introduced in other modules fit within current computer security definitions.  The module also explores the technology to support computer security throughout.

The module will require students to undertake evaluation of systems to understand vulnerabilities and mitigations.  This will best place students to understand the requirements of security as they enter the workplace.
